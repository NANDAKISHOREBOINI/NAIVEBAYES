In fact, it instructs one to kill under\\n#certain circumstances.     \\n\\nI'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them\\nto kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between\\nmotivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'\\natoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather\\ndepends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about\\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\\nIt's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\\napart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly\\nharmless.\\n#\\n#|> For my part, I conclude that something\\n#|> else is required.

And my definition of religion is broader than my\\ndefinition of theism, as I have explained.\\n#\\n#|> #By insisting that even the murder of four labourers, chosen because\\n#|> #they were catholics, and who had nothing to do with the IRA, by \\n#|> #Protestant extremists, is *not* religously motivated, I think what \\n#|> #you are saying is that you simply will not accept *any* murder as \\n#|> #being religiously motivated.\\n#|> \\n#|> No.  What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed \\n#|> he was the devil incarnate?  That was religously motivated.\\n#\\n#What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic \\n#labourers?     That *wasn't* religiously motivated?\\n\\nNot in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure\\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \"religion did this\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \\nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\\nto read minds.\\n#\\n#\\n#|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\\n#|> and the many religous wars.\\n#\\n#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a\\n#grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders\\n#to be religiously motivated?    What's the general principle behind\\n#all this?\\n\\nThe general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that\\nreligion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \\nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \\nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \\nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \\nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \\ntogether, said participants.

The \\nparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they \\nwere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  \\ninvolved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.

      "1. **Data Preprocessing:** Text data often requires extensive preprocessing to remove noise and irrelevant information. This can include handling missing values, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and dealing with inconsistencies in formatting.\n",
      "2. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting appropriate features from the text data is crucial for model performance. Techniques like TF-IDF can be effective but may not capture all the relevant information. Exploring different feature extraction methods or domain-specific features might be necessary.\n",
      "3. **Model Selection:** Choosing the right classification model for the task is important. While Naive Bayes is a good baseline, more complex models like Support Vector Machines or deep learning models might yield better results, depending on the data and problem complexity.\n",
      "4. **Class Imbalance:** If certain classes in the target variable are significantly underrepresented, the model may struggle to accurately predict those classes. Techniques like oversampling or using cost-sensitive learning can help address this issue.\n",
      "5. **Handling Sentiment:** Sentiment analysis can provide additional insights but may require careful consideration. The sentiment polarity scores might not always align perfectly with the classification task. Incorporating sentiment features effectively can improve performance.\n",
      "6. **Computational Resources:** Training and evaluating models on large text datasets can be computationally demanding. Choosing appropriate techniques for feature extraction and model training, and leveraging cloud resources if needed, is important.\n",
      "7. **Model Interpretability:** Understanding why the model makes certain predictions can be challenging with complex models. Techniques for model interpretation, such as examining feature importance or using simpler models, can be helpful.\n"
